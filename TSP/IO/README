Project Description:

The traveling salesman problem involves finding the path with the shortest distance for a graph. 
The path can start at any node and must visit all nodes and return to the starting node with 
the shortest path. No poly-time solution has been discovered for this problem so only 
approximations will be used in this program.

File Descriptions:

Main.c - program entry 
StructDef.h - struct definition header file
UserInt.h/c - file IO and other user interface generic functions
Algos.h/c - primary TSP solver algorithms 

Instructions:

1) 	Build the project by entering "make" in directory with project files and makefile.
2) 	Enter TSP filename where filename is the file with the input data. 
3) 	The results are stored in file named filename.tour where filename is the entire 
	file name of the input file.
