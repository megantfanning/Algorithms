Project Description:
the maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers, which has the largest sum

File Descriptions:
The Algorithms themselves are encapsulated in the Algos.c file
Test cases are being run by the main.c program
UserInt.c provides works in conjunction with main to create the experimental runtime results for all algorithms. 
DynamicArray.c provides code for a dynamic array structure utilized in testing
Program reads the input MSS_Problems.txt. 
Output written to MSS_Results.txt

Instructions for running the project
1) Correctness - enter "prog Correctness filenametobeparsed"
The results are dumped to "Results.txt" with a number extension for each test.
2) Experimental - enter "prog Experimenal"
The results are dumped to "Exp.txt" with a number extension for each test.
