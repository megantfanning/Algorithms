Project Description:
the maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers,
which has the largest sum

File Descriptions:
The Algorithms themselves are primarily encapsulated in the Algos.c file
Test cases are being run by the main.c program
DynamicArray.c provides code for a dynamic array structure utilized in testing

Instructions for running the project
1) Correctness - enter "prog Correctness filenametobeparsed"
